However, a shortcoming of the TopologyTestDriver is that it only supports topics with one partition, therefore making it difficult to test that data has been correctly partitioned throughout the entire topology. This is especially relevant for topologies utilizing PAPI, where the user has to manage the partitioning of the data.\r\n\r\nA simple starting point could be to keep the current fully synchronous execution for a single input event, just with a TestInputTopic that supports a \u201cPartitioner\u201d.", "reporter": {"self": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hermankj", "name": "hermankj", "key": "JIRAUSER302672", "avatarUrls": {"48x48": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=JIRAUSER302672&avatarId=52978", "24x24": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=JIRAUSER302672&avatarId=52978", "16x16": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=JIRAUSER302672&avatarId=52978", "32x32": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=JIRAUSER302672&avatarId=52978"}, "displayName": "Herman Kolstad Jakobsen", "active": true, "timeZone": "Europe/Oslo"}, "comment": {"comments": [], "maxResults": 0, "total": 0, "startAt": 0}, "priority": {"self": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/priority/4", "iconUrl": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/priorities/minor.svg", "name": "Minor", "id": "4"}, "status": {"self": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/status/1", "description": "The issue is open and ready for the assignee to start work on it.", "iconUrl": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/statuses/open.png", "name": "Open", "id": "1", "statusCategory": {"self": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/statuscategory/2", "id": 2, "key": "new", "colorName": "blue-gray", "name": "To Do"}}}}
