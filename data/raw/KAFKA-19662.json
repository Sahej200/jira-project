One use for this is to initialise the start offset before starting to use the share group. Currently, the tool only lets the user reset the start offset for a topic which already has offsets in the share group. Instead, it should permit setting the SPSO for any topic, subject to auth checking.\r\n\r\nThis brings the tool's behaviour in line with kafka-consumer-groups.sh.", "reporter": {"self": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=schofielaj", "name": "schofielaj", "key": "schofielaj", "avatarUrls": {"48x48": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452", "24x24": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452", "16x16": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452", "32x32": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"}, "displayName": "Andrew Schofield", "active": true, "timeZone": "Etc/UTC"}, "comment": {"comments": [], "maxResults": 0, "total": 0, "startAt": 0}, "priority": {"self": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/priority/3", "iconUrl": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/priorities/major.svg", "name": "Major", "id": "3"}, "status": {"self": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/status/5", "description": "A resolution has been taken, and it is awaiting verification by reporter.
