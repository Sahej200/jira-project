This overhead leads to slight performance latency in our applications.", "reporter": {"self": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hemanthboyina", "name": "hemanthboyina", "key": "hemanthboyina", "avatarUrls": {"48x48": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452", "24x24": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452", "16x16": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452", "32x32": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"}, "displayName": "Hemanth Boyina", "active": true, "timeZone": "Etc/UTC"}, "comment": {"comments": [], "maxResults": 0, "total": 0, "startAt": 0}, "priority": {"self": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/priority/2", "iconUrl": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/priorities/critical.svg", "name": "Critical", "id": "2"}, "status": {"self": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/status/1", "description": "The issue is open and ready for the assignee to start work on it.", "iconUrl": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/statuses/open.png", "name": "Open", "id": "1", "statusCategory": {"self": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/statuscategory/2", "id": 2, "key": "new", "colorName": "blue-gray", "name": "To Do"}}}}
