Step 3 is where I may need some guidance and help. \r\n\r\nDo you think this is a good approach?", "updateAuthor": {"self": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shashankhs", "name": "shashankhs", "key": "JIRAUSER310276", "avatarUrls": {"48x48": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452", "24x24": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452", "16x16": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452", "32x32": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"}, "displayName": "Shashank", "active": true, "timeZone": "Etc/UTC"}, "created": "2025-09-07T22:30:25.754+0000", "updated": "2025-09-07T22:30:25.754+0000"}], "maxResults": 1, "total": 1, "startAt": 0}, "priority": {"self": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/priority/1", "iconUrl": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/priorities/blocker.svg", "name": "Blocker", "id": "1"}, "status": {"self": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/status/3", "description": "This issue is being actively worked on at the moment by the assignee.", "iconUrl": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/statuses/inprogress.png", "name": "In Progress", "id": "3", "statusCategory": {"self": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/statuscategory/4", "id": 4, "key": "indeterminate", "colorName": "yellow", "name": "In Progress"}}}}
