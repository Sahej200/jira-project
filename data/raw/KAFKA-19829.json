In some cases, the first joining member gets all active tasks assigned, and is slow to revoke the tasks after more member has joined the group. This affects in particular cases where the first member is slow (possibly overloaded in the case of cloudlimits benchmarks) and there are a lot of tasks to be assigned.\r\n\r\nTo help with this situation, we want to introduce a new group-specific configuration to delay the initial rebalance.", "reporter": {"self": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=travisz", "name": "travisz", "key": "JIRAUSER310382", "avatarUrls": {"48x48": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=34043", "24x24": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=34043", "16x16": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=34043", "32x32": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=34043"}, "displayName": "travis", "active": true, "timeZone": "Etc/UTC"}, "comment": {"comments": [], "maxResults": 0, "total": 0, "startAt": 0}, "priority": {"self": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/priority/3", "iconUrl": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/priorities/major.svg", "name": "Major", "id": "3"}, "status": {"self": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/status/10002", "description": "A patch for this issue has been uploaded to JIRA by a contributor.", "iconUrl": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/statuses/document.png", "name": "Patch Available", "id": "10002", "statusCategory": {"self": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/statuscategory/4", "id": 4, "key": "indeterminate", "colorName": "yellow", "name": "In Progress"}}}}
