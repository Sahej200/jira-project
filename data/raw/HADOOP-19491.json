When creating a directory, we set hdi_isfolder to true. Currently, our method for checking if the path is a directory involves a case-sensitive equality check. Consequently, if someone configures a directory with Hdi_isfolder, the driver will not recognize that path as a directory. We need to address this issue because, in the backend, hdi_isfolder and Hdi_isfolder are considered the same metadata attribute. Therefore, the solution involves modifying our equality check to be case-insensitive, ensuring that the driver correctly identifies directories regardless of case variations in the metadata attribute.", "reporter": {"self": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bhattmanish98", "name": "bhattmanish98", "key": "JIRAUSER306911", "avatarUrls": {"48x48": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452", "24x24": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452", "16x16": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452", "32x32": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"}, "displayName": "Manish Bhatt", "active": true, "timeZone": "Asia/Kolkata"}, "comment": {"comments": [], "maxResults": 0, "total": 0, "startAt": 0}, "priority": {"self": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/priority/3", "iconUrl": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/priorities/major.svg", "name": "Major", "id": "3"}, "status": {"self": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/status/5", "description": "A resolution has been taken, and it is awaiting verification by reporter.
