But when records being de-duplicated, there is no log in the broker side. This will confuse the producer because the records sent going to nowhere. Sometimes it's caused by the buggy producer that keeps using the wrong sequence number to cause the duplicated records. We should at least log the duplicated records info instead of pretending nothing happened.", "reporter": {"self": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=showuon", "name": "showuon", "key": "showuon", "avatarUrls": {"48x48": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=showuon&avatarId=42594", "24x24": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=showuon&avatarId=42594", "16x16": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=showuon&avatarId=42594", "32x32": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=showuon&avatarId=42594"}, "displayName": "Luke Chen", "active": true, "timeZone": "Etc/UTC"}, "comment": {"comments": [], "maxResults": 0, "total": 0, "startAt": 0}, "priority": {"self": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/priority/3", "iconUrl": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/priorities/major.svg", "name": "Major", "id": "3"}, "status": {"self": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/status/5", "description": "A resolution has been taken, and it is awaiting verification by reporter.
