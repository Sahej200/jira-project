This means when calculating idle time, each pool divides by its own {{numIoThreads}}\u00a0value before reporting to the shared meter and\u00a0\u00a0{{RequestHandlerAvgIdlePercent}}\u00a0calculates the final result by accumulating all the values reported by all threads. However, since there are actually 2 \u00d7 numIoThreads total threads contributing to the metric, the denominator should be doubled to get the correct average.", "reporter": {"self": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tzyyzt2025", "name": "tzyyzt2025", "key": "JIRAUSER310579", "avatarUrls": {"48x48": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=34061", "24x24": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=34061", "16x16": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=34061", "32x32": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=34061"}, "displayName": "tony tang", "active": true, "timeZone": "Etc/UTC"}, "comment": {"comments": [], "maxResults": 0, "total": 0, "startAt": 0}, "priority": {"self": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/priority/3", "iconUrl": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/priorities/major.svg", "name": "Major", "id": "3"}, "status": {"self": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/status/5", "description": "A resolution has been taken, and it is awaiting verification by reporter.
