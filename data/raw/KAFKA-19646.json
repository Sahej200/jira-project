According to Kafka's design, such disk-level failures should be isolated via\u00a0{{{}logDirFailureChannel{}}}, allowing other healthy disks to continue serving traffic. However, upon reviewing the\u00a0{{CheckpointFileWithFailureHandler}}\u00a0implementation, we observed that while methods like\u00a0{{{}write{}}},\u00a0{{{}read{}}}, and\u00a0{{writeIfDirExists}}\u00a0handle\u00a0{{IOException}}\u00a0by routing the affected\u00a0{{log.dir}}\u00a0to\u00a0{{{}logDirFailureChannel{}}}, the checkpoint initialization process lacks this fault-tolerant behavior. Should checkpoint creation adopt the same failure-handling logic? If this is not an intentional design, I will submit a PR to fix this issue.", "reporter": {"self": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ktktk", "name": "ktktk", "key": "JIRAUSER306715", "avatarUrls": {"48x48": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452", "24x24": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452", "16x16": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452", "32x32": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"}, "displayName": "Haozhong Ma", "active": true, "timeZone": "Etc/UTC"}, "comment": {"comments": [], "maxResults": 0, "total": 0, "startAt": 0}, "priority": {"self": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/priority/3", "iconUrl": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/priorities/major.svg", "name": "Major", "id": "3"}, "status": {"self": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/status/6", "description": "The issue is considered finished, the resolution is correct.
