However, MetadataRequest does not support the partitionSizeLimitPerResponse option. This means that pagination is effectively unsupported for topic ID\u2013based requests.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, partitionSizeLimitPerResponse is supported by DescribeTopicPartitionsRequest. However, this RPC currently only supports topic names, not topic IDs. To enable full pagination support across both topic names and topic IDs, we would need to extend DescribeTopicPartitionsRequest to accept topic IDs as an additional field.", "reporter": {"self": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=brandboat", "name": "brandboat", "key": "brandboat", "avatarUrls": {"48x48": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=brandboat&avatarId=29065", "24x24": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=brandboat&avatarId=29065", "16x16": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=brandboat&avatarId=29065", "32x32": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=brandboat&avatarId=29065"}, "displayName": "Kuan Po Tseng", "active": true, "timeZone": "Asia/Taipei"}, "comment": {"comments": [], "maxResults": 0, "total": 0, "startAt": 0}, "priority": {"self": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/priority/3", "iconUrl": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/priorities/major.svg", "name": "Major", "id": "3"}, "status": {"self": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/status/1", "description": "The issue is open and ready for the assignee to start work on it.", "iconUrl": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/statuses/open.png", "name": "Open", "id": "1", "statusCategory": {"self": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/statuscategory/2", "id": 2, "key": "new", "colorName": "blue-gray", "name": "To Do"}}}}
