Specifically in the peculiar case of using the callback together with commitSync, the acknowledgement callback for the committed records is called at the start of the next eligible call, even though the information is already known at the end of the commitSync's execution. The results are correct already, but the timing could be improved in some situations.", "reporter": {"self": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=schofielaj", "name": "schofielaj", "key": "schofielaj", "avatarUrls": {"48x48": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452", "24x24": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452", "16x16": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452", "32x32": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"}, "displayName": "Andrew Schofield", "active": true, "timeZone": "Etc/UTC"}, "comment": {"comments": [], "maxResults": 0, "total": 0, "startAt": 0}, "priority": {"self": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/priority/3", "iconUrl": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/priorities/major.svg", "name": "Major", "id": "3"}, "status": {"self": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/status/5", "description": "A resolution has been taken, and it is awaiting verification by reporter.
