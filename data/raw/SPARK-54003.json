This has at least the following issues:\r\n\r\n* As described in SPARK-37210, conflicts can occur when multiple partitions job of the same table are run concurrently. Using a staging directory can avoid this issue.\r\n* As described in SPARK-53937, using a staging directory allows for near-atomic operations.\r\n\r\n_*Dynamic partition overwrite*_ mode and *_custom partition path_* mode already use the staging directory. And *_dynamic partition overwrite_* mode and _*custom partition path*_ are implemented differently, which can be further simplified into a unified process. And in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29000, reset the staging directory as the output directory of FileOutputCommitter. This way is more safer. It should be modified to this way.", "reporter": {"self": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=zhengchenyu", "name": "zhengchenyu", "key": "zhengchenyu", "avatarUrls": {"48x48": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452", "24x24": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452", "16x16": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452", "32x32": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"}, "displayName": "Chenyu Zheng", "active": true, "timeZone": "Asia/Shanghai"}, "comment": {"comments": [], "maxResults": 0, "total": 0, "startAt": 0}, "priority": {"self": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/priority/3", "iconUrl": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/priorities/major.svg", "name": "Major", "id": "3"}, "status": {"self": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/status/1", "description": "The issue is open and ready for the assignee to start work on it.", "iconUrl": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/statuses/open.png", "name": "Open", "id": "1", "statusCategory": {"self": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/statuscategory/2", "id": 2, "key": "new", "colorName": "blue-gray", "name": "To Do"}}}}
