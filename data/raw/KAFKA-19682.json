We have observed cases, in which Kafka Streams seems to get stuck on a partition, and restarting the application instance resolves this issue. We suspect, it's related to considering the task for the stuck partition as not ready for processing. (As the ready/not-ready decision is based on in-memory state of KS runtime, bouncing the instance would reset KS runtime into a clean state, unblocking the stuck task.)\r\n\r\nHowever, we currently don't have sufficient logging to reason about this case, and to understand if and why a task might be skipped. We should add more log statement (DEBUG and/or TRACE) to get better visibility. There might be a lurking bug in this logic that we cannot narrow down w/o the corresponding information logging could provide.", "reporter": {"self": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mjsax", "name": "mjsax", "key": "mjsax", "avatarUrls": {"48x48": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=mjsax&avatarId=29314", "24x24": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=mjsax&avatarId=29314", "16x16": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=mjsax&avatarId=29314", "32x32": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=mjsax&avatarId=29314"}, "displayName": "Matthias J.
