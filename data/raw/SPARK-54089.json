Including:\r\n\r\n# LongToUnsafeRowMap (for long key hash join)\r\n# ExternalSorter (for non-serializable sort-based shuffle)\r\n\r\nIt's ideal to make them support off-heap when Spark is running with off-heap memory mode. For 3rd accelerator plugins that leverage Spark off-heap memory, having the large allocations in vanilla Spark supporting off-heap mode will significantly ease the memory settings for running the mixed query plan that contains both vanilla Spark and offloaded computations.
