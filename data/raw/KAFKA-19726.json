I.e. there's some logic to consolidate/merge settings from the broker and from the client. During that step, it should be doable to throw an exception if there's an invalid configuration. This ticket is specifically for throwing an exception if the client overrides `replication.factor` with a value that is less than `min.insync.replicas` specified by the broker. This check should happen where the \u201cmerging\u201d logic happens, on the broker side.", "reporter": {"self": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=gghiro", "name": "gghiro", "key": "JIRAUSER310713", "avatarUrls": {"48x48": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452", "24x24": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452", "16x16": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452", "32x32": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"}, "displayName": "Genseric Ghiro", "active": true, "timeZone": "Etc/UTC"}, "comment": {"comments": [], "maxResults": 0, "total": 0, "startAt": 0}, "priority": {"self": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/priority/4", "iconUrl": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/priorities/minor.svg", "name": "Minor", "id": "4"}, "status": {"self": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/status/1", "description": "The issue is open and ready for the assignee to start work on it.", "iconUrl": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/statuses/open.png", "name": "Open", "id": "1", "statusCategory": {"self": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/statuscategory/2", "id": 2, "key": "new", "colorName": "blue-gray", "name": "To Do"}}}}
