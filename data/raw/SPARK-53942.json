There has been consistent requests for unblocking this.\r\n\r\nThe main reason of the limitation is due to the fact the stateful operator has fixed partitions and we should make sure it is unchanged. While the invariant is not changed, there is no technical reason to also disallow changing of the number of shuffle partitions in stateless shuffle e.g. stream-static join, MERGE INTO, etcetc.", "reporter": {"self": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kabhwan", "name": "kabhwan", "key": "kabhwan", "avatarUrls": {"48x48": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452", "24x24": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452", "16x16": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452", "32x32": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"}, "displayName": "Jungtaek Lim", "active": true, "timeZone": "Asia/Seoul"}, "comment": {"comments": [{"self": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13631790/comment/18032925", "id": "18032925", "author": {"self": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kabhwan", "name": "kabhwan", "key": "kabhwan", "avatarUrls": {"48x48": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452", "24x24": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452", "16x16": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452", "32x32": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"}, "displayName": "Jungtaek Lim", "active": true, "timeZone": "Asia/Seoul"}, "body": "Issue resolved by pull request 52645\n[https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/52645]", "updateAuthor": {"self": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kabhwan", "name": "kabhwan", "key": "kabhwan", "avatarUrls": {"48x48": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452", "24x24": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452", "16x16": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452", "32x32": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"}, "displayName": "Jungtaek Lim", "active": true, "timeZone": "Asia/Seoul"}, "created": "2025-10-25T08:57:53.988+0000", "updated": "2025-10-25T08:57:53.988+0000"}], "maxResults": 1, "total": 1, "startAt": 0}, "priority": {"self": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/priority/3", "iconUrl": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/priorities/major.svg", "name": "Major", "id": "3"}, "status": {"self": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/status/5", "description": "A resolution has been taken, and it is awaiting verification by reporter.
